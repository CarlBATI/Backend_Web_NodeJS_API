* Knex Migrations
To rollback all migrations and then rerun them, you can use the `knex migrate:rollback` command with the `--all` flag to rollback all migrations, and then use the `knex migrate:latest` command to run all migrations. Here's how you can do it:

#+begin_src shell
npx knex migrate:rollback --all
npx knex migrate:latest
#+end_src

The `~knex migrate:rollback --all~` command rolls back all migrations, and the `~knex migrate:latest~` command runs all migrations.

Please note that you need to be in the root directory of your project where the `knexfile.js` is located when you run these commands. Also, make sure that your `knexfile.js` is correctly configured with your database information.
